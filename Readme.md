 The purpose of this project will be to learn how to use react and django together to develop a full stack web application. Specifically we will be creating a collaborative music playing app in which we will integrate our application with the third party Spotify API. 

 Some of the technologies used include Python and Django for the back end, React, NPM and Node.js for the front end
